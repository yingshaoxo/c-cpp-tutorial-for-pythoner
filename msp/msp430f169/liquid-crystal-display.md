# Liquid-crystal display

## All in all

> LCD: Liquid-crystal display

Here we gonna use `ST7920` to drive a `128x64 LCD`.

If you use `Arduino` for development, then you should use [u8glib](https://github.com/olikraus/u8glib) to finish this mission as quickly as possible.

## SPI Interface

SPI = Serial Peripheral Interface

To be honest, I don't really know those things.

* Clock \(SPI CLK, SCLK\)
* Chip select \(CS\)
* Master out, slave in \(MOSI\)
* Master in, slave out \(MISO\)

SPI is a synchronous, full duplex master-slave-based interface.

The device that generates the clock signal is called the master. Data transmitted between the master and the slave is synchronized to the clock generated by the master.

SPI interfaces can have only one master and can have one or multiple slaves.

The chip select signal from the master is used to select the slave.

MOSI and MISO are the data lines. MOSI transmits data from the master to the slave and MISO transmits data from the slave to the master.
